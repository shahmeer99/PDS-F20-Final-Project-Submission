These are the following steps you will need to perform the scraping for the PSA website. 

1. Manually open the rankings page and choose the selected month-year combiniation. Press the load more button until the top 200 ranks are 
displayed (you can keep going depending how much you can keep going depedning on how many you want). Once loaded, save that webpage in 'single HTML file' format. The
extension for such a file will be '.mhtml'. Save this file in the following format: "<year>_<month>_rankings.mhtml" (e.g: january_2018_rankings.mhtml). Note that all characters are 
lower cased. Save all such files in a folder/directory called 'links' and put this directory in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook. 

2. Now the manual set up is done. Run the 'Making Unqiue Links' Cell in the notebook.

3. Call the 'group_source_extractor()' function.

4. Run the cells that follow that in the Web Scraping section of the notebook till the end of the section and results will be saved in a csv file with the name 
   'squash_rankings_till_sept_2020.csv'. This name can be changed to anything you please.
